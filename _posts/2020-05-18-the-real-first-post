Alright, so this is blogging, I guess. I'm not sure what I want to do with this space quite yet, aside from bringing it into existence. It's actually a pretty apt mirror of my current situation, where I constantly find myself teetering on the fence between personal and professional, with this site and its purpose being the most recent extension of that. 

This more often happens with my time and how I choose (or rather have chosen) to spend it. The constant push and pull between the lax nature of my final term of undergrad and the frankly exhuasting grind searching for my first *real* job. Like it's not like I don't want a job, the idea of being self sufficient is what gets me up in the morning, but I would be lying if I said that the process of searching for one is just absolutely draining. Every time I sit down at this desk, I'm constantly hitting my head against this brick wall with the promise that eventually one of its constituents will be moved, and I will be allowed into 'the industry'. It is the very definition of an attritional process in regards to my sense of self, confidence in my abilities, and certainty in my future. So, naturally, as is the nature of those like myself, I stick my head in the sand and wait for the big bad to stop, or at least go away. *Hey let's make that website you've always wanted! Hey wow, lets get back into all these games! Have a buncha spare time, time to hone that mac n cheese recipe you make **only on Thanksgiving**.* And like yeah, I get it, these are weird times, I'm not even sure if I can get a job in general, or what the next even 2 months of my life will look like, but I still keep running away from this hurdle, diving into literally whatever else I can do besides literally better my own future. But I mean hey- whatever, I've managed to stumble through 21 years of life, so I don't expect that I'll come to a stop anytime soon; just anxiously vomiting words into the ether (side note: ether is easily in my top 10 words, so yes I will risk sounding like a massive tool just so I can use it).

*ANYWAYS* moving on from that crisis, not much else is really going on in my life, aside from this site. I decided to take the plunge and try my hand at setting this up around a week ago, and I just now got a basic state of it up on the net. I learned a lot of things- or more so relearned alot of things about both git and myself during the process, being once again reminded of **cd**, **ls**, and also how short my temper is when I can't firgure something out. It's fun though, not throwing a temper tantrum, but working with computers and learning a new scripting syntax. I've always touted the idea that it is one of the most satisfying things you can do with your time, and I'm glad I've finally found a way I can engage with it outside of work, since the removal of deadlines and arbitrary restrictions leave only the best parts of the process. The site, as of writing this, looks very basic, and I'd like to change that, but my lack of experience means it's going to take quite a while to do all the things I'd like to do. Normally I'd huff and puff over having to *gasp* put time into something, but this time around, I'm actually, pretty excited to roll up my sleeves and do something that I feel is truly productive, and a lot more fun than how I've been spending my free time recently (read: video games). I think I'm going to go for a nice off-white theme for the site, navy text accents, minimalist, you know, standard internet code-jockey douche aesthetic stuff.     


Well, reading back over this, I think I've settled on what I'm going to do here: a personal lifestyle(ish?) blog where I can talk about what I want, when I want. Almost like a journal I guess, but with the added benefit that it's posted online so you -the reader- can hop in and go, "Hey I wonder what crisis Ali is going through right now?". I'm not all too good at opening up to people, or even talking to my friends for that matter, so this seems to be my take on how to remedy this issue instead of you know, *talking* to them, but hey, I'm trying ok? Alright, time to call it, I promise I'll tone down the text formatting (probably not), I'm just excited right now. Take care, drink some water, and for the love of God, fucking stay home.
